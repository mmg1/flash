## Installation

  Flash web framework is for PHP, so it's requires PHP 5.6 or newer. now you wonâ€™t need to setup anything just yet.

### Flash can be installed in few steps:

  - [Download](https://github.com/rajkumardusad/flash/archive/master.zip) the Flash files.
  - Unzip the package.
  - Upload all the Flash folders and files (application, system, .htaccess, index.php) on the server.

```
  /public_html
      /application
      /system
      .htaccess
      index.php
```

  That's it, in the Flash web framework there is nothing to configure and setup. it's always ready to go.

### For Linux

  A quick setup for linux and android devices.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/rajkumardusad/flash
$ cd flash
$ php -S localhost:8080 index.php
```

  That's it, in the Flash web framework there is nothing to configure and setup. it's always ready to go.
